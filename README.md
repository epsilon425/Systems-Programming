This project will include step by step coding I have gone through in order to become familiarized and adept in Systems Programming using the standard POSIX syscalls.          

1. Goldbach  
-Practices: Bit mapping, Bit operations, general algorithm  
-function: calulates all prime numbers up to user's input and uses the prime numbers to get two highest prime numbers that results to another user's input.    
2. Archive  
-Practices: Standard I/O of POSIX as well as traversing a file by its raw data, and general algorithm  
-function: Emulates the POSIX ar Syscall. Compatible with the actual ar Syscall.
