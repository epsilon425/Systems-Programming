Goldbach will take in one parameter(int) and calculate all prime numbers upto that number. It will do so by creating a bit map and using bit operations to mark off all bits corresponding to non prime numbers.  
After all prime number has been found, it will ask for another even number through scanff. Goldbach will then find the largest two prime numbers that adds up to the even number.  
The following program gives introduction to the bit operations and basic standard I/O neccessary for Systems Programming.
